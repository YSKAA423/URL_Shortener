### URL Shortener Project

A URL shortener project developed as part of the Python Development Internship at CodeClause, utilizing Python and the Cutt.ly API to create short, manageable URLs.

Overview
This project includes two main components:

API-based URL Shortener: Utilizes the Cutt.ly service to generate shortened URLs.
Custom URL Shortener: A built-from-scratch system that employs base62 encoding to transform long URLs into shorter versions, stored within a simple Python dictionary.
Features
Shorten URLs using Cutt.ly API: Quickly convert long URLs into short links through an external API.
Base62 Encoding for URL Shortening: Locally convert URLs to short identifiers using base62 encoding, without external dependencies.
Simple In-Memory Storage: Use Python dictionaries to map original URLs to their shortened forms.
Usage
API-based URL Shortener
Ensure you have an API key from Cutt.ly and configure it in your config.py.
Call shorten_url_service(long_url) to get a shortened URL using Cutt.ly.
Custom URL Shortener
Create an instance of the URLshortener class.
Call shorten_url(long_url, alias=None) to shorten a URL. The alias parameter is optional.
Retrieve the original URL using retrieve_original_url(short_url).
Future Enhancements
Persistent Storage: Plans to replace the dictionary with a database to handle scalability.
Error Handling Improvements: Enhance the robustness of input validation and error responses.
